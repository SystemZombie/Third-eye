# Project Title: THIRD EYE
This is a project created to help the police department for their ease to catch the criminals immediately they commit a crime like kidnap.
Once the CCTV camera in the streets detects the crime it transfers the photo to the nearby police station for 2nd level of verification.
Once the police verifies it as a crime, the crime gets updated in the google maps which is accessible by the public so that they'll be 
aware of the current scenario and it also helps the ### tourism. 

# How do we catch the criminals:
We have used triangulation method to trace and track down the criminals.
Once the CCTV camera detects the crime it traces the vehicle number plate of the criminals and sends the information to the CCTV camera around 2km radius.
If camera A detects the crime it sends the number plate to camera B and camera C which are in 2km redius so that police will the be updated about the location
of the criminals instantaneously.
